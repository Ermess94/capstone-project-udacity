### Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree Program

# Capstone Project

## Starbucks Capstone Challenge

### Overview

This is the final project for the Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree Program.

The dataset comprises simulated data that reflects customer interactions with the Starbucks rewards mobile app. Starbucks periodically sends offers to users of the app, which can include advertisements for drinks or actual promotions like discounts or buy-one-get-one-free (BOGO) deals. It's important to note that some users may not receive any offers during certain weeks.

Not all users get the same offers, presenting a challenge to analyze this dataset.

The objective is to integrate transaction, demographic, and offer data to identify which demographic segments respond most favorably to specific offer types. This dataset is a simplified representation of the actual Starbucks app, as the underlying simulator includes only one product, while Starbucks offers a variety of items.
